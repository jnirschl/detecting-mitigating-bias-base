        "#### Objective:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Audit a model for bias when the protected class is not available.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Introduction\n",
        " - Set up problem\n",
        " - Load data and display primary and secondary sets\n",
        " - Load model to audit for bias\n",
        " - Train model from proxy variables to predict the protected class\n",
        " - Assess the model bias\n",
        " - Report your findings\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Importance to Project:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Very often, protected class information is not available when you are auditing for bias or removing bias.  \n",
        " - In these cases, the task becomes much more challenging. \n",
        " - You might not have access to the protected class information either because you can only see the model itself and not the underlying data, or because even the original creators don't know the protected class status of each row. \n",
        " - While auditing or mitigating bias without direct access to the protected class introduces a level of uncertainty, we can still reach some conclusions about biased models, but must be open about the uncertainty.\n",
        " - The most powerful techniques are beyond the scope of this milestone. However, knowing some baseline techniques can be helpful in easy cases and can help guide a decision whether to pursue a more in-depth audit.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Resources:\n",
        "\n",
        " - You should be able to proceed with this milestone without any additional resources. However, the following resources will provide useful context and more information.\n",
        "  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00285.pdf and accompanying video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-ZI1VoA-O0]. Milestone 4 tracks this paper closely - the main difference is in methodology.\n",
        "  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11154.pdf - This paper demonstrates some of the weaknesses of proxy-based approaches\n",
        "  - https://github.com/cfpb/proxy-methodology - This repository contains the BISG proxy methodology\n",

        "We can still assess algorithmic fairness when the protected class is unobserved, provided we have some way to deduce the protected class from the available data. The most famous real-world example of this is the BISG proxy, which uses a Naive Bayes model to predict race membership based on name and zipcode. As [Chen et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11154.pdf) note, \"This methodology notably supported a $98 million fine against a major auto loan lender\".\n",
        "\n",
        "While the BISG proxy methodology is still used and developed, recent scholarship in machine fairness demonstrates some serious shortcomings and some new directions for modelling without access to protected class data. The fundamental issue is that proxy models, unless highly accurate, could skew the audit. For instance, [Chen et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11154.pdf) showed the BISG methodology has been shown to overestimate true disparities. In summary, we need to exercise great care when building proxy models and imputing protected class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of new directions for assessing algorithmic fairness when the protected class is unobserved, an interesting paper released this year entitled [\"Assessing Algorithmic Fairness with Unobserved Protected Class Using Data Combination\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00285.pdf) describes a methodology for estimating confidence intervals for bias metrics. While the methodology is too complex to review here, in the course of this milestone it will become clear why confidence intervals are so useful. It is well worth considering for any bias audit where the protected class is unavailable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regardless of the chosen methodology, the general setup requires the following datasets:\n",
        " - a primary dataset, which contains input variables to the model and the model's final prediction\n",
        " - a secondary dataset, which contains some proxy variables which overlap with the primary dataset, and does contain the protected class labels\n",
        "     \n",
        "An example of a primary set and secondary set in a lending context with potential racial bias can be found below (proxy variables are surname and zipcode, as in BISG, and they can be found in both the primary and secondary sets)"

A similar model built on the same dataset has already been audited using state-of-the-art partial identification sets in a recent paper by Kallus, Mao and Zhou. We will be using a simpler methodology.\n",

        "\n",
        "In these circumstances, dosage by trial and error is dangerous, so the medical community has built models to predict the ideal warfarin dosage. These models can be found in section 8.2 of [\"Assessing Algorithmic Fairness with Unobserved Protected Class Using Data Combination\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00285.pdf). The makers of the models note that genetic factors correlated with race are predictive of the outcome, so we can expect dosage and dosage prediction to differ by race. In this scenario, the WTO has asked you to audit the model's bias with respect to race. \n",
        "\n",
        "For this audit, we are going to simulate an environment where race data is not available. To audit the model's bias with respect to race, one method is to train a proxy model on a primary set as described above. Instead of approaching the problem blindly, you are given two categories of columns: genetic features, and medication features. "
